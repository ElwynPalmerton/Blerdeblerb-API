docker images - list local images.
docker ps - list running containers


Ran this to build:
docker build . -t blerb-api:1

Run the image above in a container
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 blerb-api:1



1. Add a separate docker-compose for the API in the root of the API.
    :: Test this locally with the TEST endpoint.

2. Cut and paste the mongo code form the Nana tutorial.
    :: Check to see that the mongo UI works with the mongo db.
    :: Test register and login endpoints from containerized API.
    :: Add the environment variables for 
        - MONGODB_URI
        - TEMP_SECRET
        - ENVIRONMENT?
    :: Make sure that the environment variables, naming, and endpoints used match
        the actual containerized mongoDB.

3. Figure out what's going on with the naming and container-image generation in the UI docker-compose.
    :: Change the name in the docker-compose to blerdeblurb-UI.

4. Move all of this into the UI's docker-compose and test all functionality.
    :: if this doesn't initially work.
    :: Call the test endpoint from Postman.
    :: Move the TEST endpoint into a useEffect in the frontend.
